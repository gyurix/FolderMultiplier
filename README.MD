# FolderMultiplier

## About

**FolderMultiplier** is a simple console application for copying the contents of any
folder containing `1-1` in it's name to folders `1-2`, `2-1`, `2-2` ... `12-1`, `12-2`.

The application also replaces any filenames and file contents from `1-1` to 
`1-2`, `2-1`, `2-2` ... `12-1`, `12-2`, except files found in folders, whose
name starts with `.`

The main goal of **FolderMultiplier** is to easily create the project files for each
week of the university semester based by using a predefined template stored in a folder
having a name, which contains `1-1`

## Usage

1. Enter `java -jar FolderMultiplier.jar` for running the application or use one of the built in runner scripts.
2. Enter the folders name, which contains a subfolder having a name containing `1-1`
